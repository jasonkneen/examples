# 🤖 LangGraph Framework Example

A simple concierge-style agent that demonstrates the basics for using the LangGraph framework with Agentuity.

### How It Works

The user's request is parsed by an LLM to determine the type of question (intent) they're asking, and the request is forwarded to the most appropriate agent to handle the response.

In this example, we just have a "Local Guide" agent that can answer questions about entertainment, sightseeing, and dining options for a specific city.

This example demonstrates in the most simple terms an LLM integration, agent-to-agent communication, and how to store user requests in key-value storage.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun**: Version 1.2.4 or higher

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent in your project:

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your agent.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agent and deploy it to the cloud, making it accessible via the Agentuity platform.
